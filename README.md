# cells-pygame
Multiplayer joystick-controlled action/strategy game made with Python and Pygame
# Setup
Python 3 and Pygame must be installed.

A joystick is required for each player. I used USB N64 controllers, but any controller that is compatible with Pygame should work.

To run the game:
```bash
python cells.py
```
